Once upon a time, Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city. The city was further expanded with the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from Eastern California. America's second largest city was originally inhabited by indigenous tribes and expanded with settlers from Spain, Mexico and then gold prospectors, land speculators, laborers, oil barons and those seeking fame in Hollywood.
